2. Open PowerShell as an administrator. Enter the following command and press Enter: Set- ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned. When prompted, press `Y` to confirm the change.
3. Use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository
4. Open your preferred IDE that supports Angular development. Open the project folder you've just cloned.
5. Open the integrated terminal in your IDE and navigate to the `/src` directory of the cloned project. Run the following command to install Angular CLI globally on your machine:
npm install -g @angular/cli
6. Still in the `/src` directory, run this command to install all the necessary project dependencies: npm install
7. After all the dependencies are installed, you can start the Angular development server by running: ng serve --o
