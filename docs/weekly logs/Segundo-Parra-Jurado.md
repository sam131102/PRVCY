## Term 2 Week (8 + Reading Week): Feb 20th - Feb 29th

### Tasks Worked On:
  - Worked on redesigning our website with updated HTML + CSS + Angular Material using the feedback we received from our peer testing. This is a work in progress, but should be done before Tuesday's class. (Week 7 Update: It remains a WIP as I am waiting for the team to finish up some other pages so I can then update the CSS/HTML + Angular Material for them.
  - Troubleshooted Jest more, I realized that Jest was simply not working with our app so I managed to research and configure a new environment for our testing. The new testing framework is called Vitest and it solves the problem with being able to locate imports called within the test cases. I'll be steadidly catching up with our test cases for the project over the coming weeks until I am fully caught up.

### Tasks I am planning to work on this upcoming week:
  - Calendar Integration UI (Not sure if I will be able to get frontend or backend work done for peer testing)
  - Adding more UI changes in preparation for our peer testing session on Tuesday.

## Term 2 Week 4: Jan 30th - Feb 1st

### Tasks Worked On:
  - After spending a few days encountering errors in SST, I attempted to fix the AWS RDS problem. After reviewing some AWS documentation I was able to troubleshoot the issue. I made two new changes to the RDS while troubleshooting, I first changed the default port number from 3306 to 13306. Then I added a new route (0.0.0.0/0) in each subnet route table within the VPC. I am not sure which of these new changes solved the issue but conenction with the RDS is finally possible! 
  - Comments attached to the video UI is implemented, but the backend is not
  - User contact remains a task I need to get working on
  - Started to implement database connectivity into our prvcy code, currently trying to allow sign up information to transfer into the 'Users' table within the database when a sign up occurs.

### Tasks I am planning to work on this upcoming week:
  - Having the RDS implemented to a greater extent within our existing functionalities
  - User contact list work
  - Write up more jest test cases

## Term 2 Week 3: Jan 23th - 25th

### Tasks Worked On:
  - Worked on implementing the SST infrastructure, ran into some issues during test deployment. I am meeting with Professor Hui on Monday and am hoping to receive feedback on how to proceed.
  - Updated the main dashboard page to better prepare for the upcoming peer testing.
  - Comments attached to the video + user contact list is still a work in progress. At this moment there is no code significant enough to commit to Github.

### Tasks I am planning to work on this upcoming week:
  - Resolve SST issues
  - Work together with the team to improve more CSS pages for peer testing
  - Write up more jest test cases

## Term 2 Week 2: Jan 16th - 18th

### Tasks Worked On:
  - Fixed the playback feature, this involved opening a new window to show the video playback rather than playing it back to the same recording window.
  - Met with Professor Hui to further find a solution towards the problems with RDS, created some DynamoDB tables but it was highly reccomended we take a look into implementing SST to help us still use an RDS as we would benefit more greatly from a relational database. I am currently reading throught the documentation and test implementing it locally, but it may require more of a team effort to implement as it affects all AWS backend archictecure.
  - Adding more Jest testing

### Tasks I am planning to work on this upcoming week:
  - Ideally the SST or an alternative RDS solution is implemented
  - This past week was more RDS/Jest/Playback fix heavy so I was unable to start working on my first Term 2 feature which is the comments attached to a video + contact list of users to send the video to.
