## Week 10:
Dates 11th March - 17th March

### Student Goals:
* Continue working on restructuring the S3 buckets system with Nikhil and Sam to accomodate the face blurring and make changes to accomodate exisiting features as well.

### Completed Tasks:
* Haven't finished moving the system to the new bucket system yet but we have an idea of how we are going to implement it. Spent time talking with Nikhil and Sam to figure out a solution and we have started implementing it but are not done yet. Just need to continue coding and we will be done soon.

We finalized the features we are going to work on throughout the project. Created a rough timeline for when major milestones need to be completed. 
I worked on the project plan and decided what features I would be working on. I also wrote up the overview for our project which listed our Minimum Viable Product along with other things such as why users would want to use 
our software etc. 

## Week 3:

I worked on the error handling for the word chain program this week. I made sure that the user input was valid and fit the parameters of our 
program. If an invalid input was entered, whether that is for the initial word or the next word, the program would keep prompting the user to enter 
a valid word.
