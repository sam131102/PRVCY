<h2>In progress tasks:</h2>

* Captioning was wrong the entire time. Previously I had thought that supplying the correct file format to the file when uploading to S3 would work, but I had not provided a parameter to the transcription request, so it did not format the file properly. That has now been fixed, and videos can now have captions attached. However, that is not done yet. It took me this week to figure out this issue and fix it, and I plan to hopefully have captions ready on videos for our next peer review session.
* Idenitified what needs to be done to change the username on the front end. I do not want to change the username using the database since there could be a mismatch between the db and Cognito, so I will use the Alias attribute given in Cognito.

<h1>Week Feb 5 - Feb 11</h1>
<h1>Student Goals</h1>

* Captioning has been fixed. While not on the video that the user has submitted, the issue with having captions ready for the video has been resolved.

Worked on the Word Chain exercise.
